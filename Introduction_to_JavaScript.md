# Introduction to JavaScript

## 1.1 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is essential for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. Originally developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, it has evolved into one of the most popular and versatile languages in web development.

## 1.2 How JavaScript Fits into Web Development
JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the web:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity

It’s primarily used on the client side, running directly in the browser, but it can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.

## 1.3 Setting Up the Development Environment
To start coding in JavaScript, you'll need:
- **A Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code is recommended for its powerful features and ease of use.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Learn to use the Console tab in DevTools to write and test JavaScript code.
- **(Optional) Node.js:** For running JavaScript outside the browser.

## 1.4 Basic JavaScript Syntax and Structure
- **Writing Your First Script:** Begin with `console.log("Hello, World!");` to print text in the console.
- **JavaScript Syntax:** Understand the basic structure, including statements, semicolons, and comments.
- **Embedding JavaScript in HTML:** Use `<script>` tags to include JavaScript in an HTML file.

## 1.5 Understanding the Role of JavaScript in Modern Web Applications
JavaScript powers the interactivity on modern websites. It allows for features like dynamic content updates, interactive forms, animations, and much more. It's supported by a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as jQuery, React, and Angular.

## 1.6 Writing and Running Basic JavaScript
- **Console Outputs:** Use `console.log` to output text, numbers, and variables.
- **Basic Data Types:** Introduce numbers, strings, and Booleans.
- **Debugging Tips:** Start with simple debugging practices using `console.log` and the browser’s DevTools.
