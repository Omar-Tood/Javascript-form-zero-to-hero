# **Asynchronous JavaScript**

## **Introduction**
Asynchronous JavaScript is a powerful concept that allows you to perform tasks in the background without blocking the execution of other code. This is especially important in web development, where tasks like data fetching, file loading, or user interaction should not freeze the entire application. Understanding how to handle asynchronous operations is key to building responsive and efficient web applications.

## **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**

### **1. Synchronous Code**
In synchronous programming, code is executed line by line, and each operation must complete before the next one begins. This can cause the browser to become unresponsive if a long-running task, such as fetching data from a server, is executed synchronously.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Start");

  function fetchData() {
      // Simulate a long-running task
      let start = Date.now();
      while (Date.now() - start < 2000) {
          // Wait for 2 seconds
      }
      console.log("Data fetched");
  }

  fetchData();
  console.log("End");
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    Start
    Data fetched (after 2 seconds)
    End
    ```

### **2. Asynchronous Code**
In asynchronous programming, code can continue executing while waiting for other operations, like fetching data, to complete. This prevents the application from becoming unresponsive.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  console.log("Start");

  function fetchData() {
      setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Data fetched");
      }, 2000);
  }

  fetchData();
  console.log("End");
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    Start
    End
    Data fetched (after 2 seconds)
    ```

## **Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript**

### **1. Callbacks**
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks were the original way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  function fetchData(callback) {
      setTimeout(() => {
          callback("Data fetched");
      }, 2000);
  }

  fetchData((message) => {
      console.log(message);
  });
  console.log("End");
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    End
    Data fetched (after 2 seconds)
    ```

### **2. Promises**
A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more manageable way than with callbacks.

- **Creating a Promise:**
  ```javascript
  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("Data fetched");
      }, 2000);
  });

  promise.then((message) => {
      console.log(message);
  }).catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
  });
  console.log("End");
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    End
    Data fetched (after 2 seconds)
    ```

### **3. Async/Await**
`async` and `await` are syntactic sugars built on top of Promises, providing a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous code. Functions marked with `async` return a Promise, and `await` is used to pause the execution until the Promise is resolved.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
      let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => {
              resolve("Data fetched");
          }, 2000);
      });

      let result = await promise; // Wait until the promise resolves
      console.log(result);
  }

  fetchData();
  console.log("End");
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    End
    Data fetched (after 2 seconds)
    ```

### **4. Error Handling in Async/Await**
When using `async/await`, errors can be caught using a `try...catch` block.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  async function fetchData() {
      try {
          let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              setTimeout(() => {
                  reject("Error fetching data");
              }, 2000);
          });

          let result = await promise;
          console.log(result);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
      }
  }

  fetchData();
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    Error fetching data (after 2 seconds)
    ```

### **5. Combining Asynchronous Operations**
You can handle multiple asynchronous operations simultaneously using `Promise.all()`, which runs multiple Promises in parallel and waits for all of them to resolve.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  async function fetchMultipleData() {
      let promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 1 fetched"), 2000);
      });

      let promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 2 fetched"), 1000);
      });

      let results = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);
      console.log(results);
  }

  fetchMultipleData();
  ```

  - **Output:**
    ```
    ["Data 1 fetched", "Data 2 fetched"] (after 2 seconds)
    ```

## **Best Practices**
- **Avoid Callback Hell**: Callback hell occurs when there are too many nested callbacks, making the code difficult to read and maintain. Use Promises or async/await to mitigate this.
- **Handle Errors Properly**: Always handle errors in asynchronous code to prevent unhandled rejections and ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Use Async/Await for Readability**: Prefer async/await over Promises for better readability, especially in complex asynchronous code.

## **Conclusion**
Asynchronous programming is a fundamental aspect of JavaScript that allows you to handle operations that take time, like network requests, without blocking the execution of other code. By mastering callbacks, Promises, and async/await, you can write more efficient and responsive web applications.

# **Local Storage and Session Storage in JavaScript**

## **Introduction**
Web Storage API provides a way to store data in the browser securely and persistently. It includes two main types of storage: Local Storage and Session Storage. These are used to store data in key-value pairs, where the data can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.

## **Local Storage**

### **1. What is Local Storage?**
Local Storage allows you to store data in the browser with no expiration time. This means that the data stored in Local Storage remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened, until it is explicitly deleted.

### **2. Working with Local Storage**

#### **Setting Items**
You can store data in Local Storage using the `setItem()` method. This method takes two arguments: the key and the value.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");
  ```

#### **Getting Items**
To retrieve data from Local Storage, you can use the `getItem()` method, which takes the key as its argument and returns the corresponding value.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  let username = localStorage.getItem("username");
  console.log(username); // Output: JohnDoe
  ```

#### **Removing Items**
You can remove a specific item from Local Storage using the `removeItem()` method, which takes the key as its argument.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  localStorage.removeItem("username");
  ```

#### **Clearing All Items**
To clear all data from Local Storage, use the `clear()` method.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  localStorage.clear();
  ```

#### **Example Usage**
- **Storing User Preferences:**
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
  localStorage.setItem("fontSize", "16px");

  let theme = localStorage.getItem("theme");
  let fontSize = localStorage.getItem("fontSize");

  console.log(`Theme: ${theme}, Font Size: ${fontSize}`);
  ```

### **3. Limitations of Local Storage**
- **Storage Limit**: Browsers typically allow up to 5MB of storage per domain.
- **String Values Only**: Local Storage only stores data as strings. If you want to store objects or arrays, you need to convert them to strings using `JSON.stringify()`.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));

  let storedUser = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
  console.log(storedUser.name); // Output: John
  ```

## **Session Storage**

### **1. What is Session Storage?**
Session Storage is similar to Local Storage, but with one key difference: the data stored in Session Storage is only available for the duration of the page session. Once the page or browser is closed, the data is automatically deleted.

### **2. Working with Session Storage**

#### **Setting Items**
You can store data in Session Storage using the `setItem()` method.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.setItem("sessionId", "123456");
  ```

#### **Getting Items**
To retrieve data from Session Storage, use the `getItem()` method.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  let sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem("sessionId");
  console.log(sessionId); // Output: 123456
  ```

#### **Removing Items**
You can remove a specific item from Session Storage using the `removeItem()` method.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.removeItem("sessionId");
  ```

#### **Clearing All Items**
To clear all data from Session Storage, use the `clear()` method.

- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.clear();
  ```

### **3. Example Usage**
- **Storing Temporary Data:**
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.setItem("currentStep", "2");

  let currentStep = sessionStorage.getItem("currentStep");
  console.log(`You are on step: ${currentStep}`);
  ```

### **4. Limitations of Session Storage**
- **Session Lifetime**: Data persists only until the page session ends. If the user closes the tab or window, the data is lost.
- **Storage Limit**: Similar to Local Storage, the limit is typically around 5MB per domain.
- **String Values Only**: Like Local Storage, Session Storage only stores strings. Use `JSON.stringify()` to store objects or arrays.

## **Differences Between Local Storage and Session Storage**

| Feature           | Local Storage                                      | Session Storage                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lifetime**      | Data persists until explicitly deleted             | Data persists only for the duration of the page session |
| **Storage Limit** | Typically around 5MB per domain                    | Typically around 5MB per domain                      |
| **Scope**         | Available across all tabs and windows for a domain | Available only in the tab or window that created it  |
| **Use Case**      | Store data that needs to persist across sessions   | Store data that should be cleared after the session ends |

## **Best Practices**

- **Use Local Storage for Persistent Data**: Store data like user preferences, tokens, or data that needs to be available across sessions.
- **Use Session Storage for Temporary Data**: Store data that is only relevant during the current session, such as form data or navigation steps.
- **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**: Do not store sensitive information (like passwords or personal details) in Local or Session Storage, as it can be accessed through JavaScript and is not encrypted.

## **Conclusion**
Local Storage and Session Storage are powerful tools for managing client-side data in web applications. By understanding the differences and use cases for each, you can effectively use them to store and manage data in your web applications.
